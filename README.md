# Music-Recommendation-System
In this project I clustered my Spotify music using its audio features with the goal of finding similar music in each of the clusters.

# System recommendation algorithms
There are three main categories of recommendation algorithms: collaborative filtering,
content-based filtering, and hybrid recommendations.
1. Collaborative filtering is based on collecting and analyzing a large amount of
information about the behavior, activities, and preferences of users and the predicting what a user
likes based on the similarity of the user to other users.
2. The content-based filtering algorithm is based on a description of the element and
a profile of a userâ€™s preferences. These algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those
that a user has liked in the past.
3. The hybrid recommendation algorithm combines collaborative filtering and
content-based filtering. In some cases, hybrid approaches can be more effective.
